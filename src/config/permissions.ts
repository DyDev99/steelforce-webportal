 * The authoritative client route-to-permission table.

 * policy data that product owners change, not an algorithm. `lib/auth/
 * authorization.ts` consumes it; guards, the sidebar, and any future
 * middleware all resolve through that one consumer, so a route can never be
 * protected in one place and open in another.
 *
 * An unmapped protected route is DENIED. Adding a route without a rule makes
 * it inaccessible rather than public — a new page cannot leak by omission.
